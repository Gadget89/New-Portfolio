# Nicolas Roybal Portfolio v.2
This is the second version of my online portfolio. I wanted to create a dark themed version of my portfolio and add animation throughout the app. In this version I want to showcase my coding skills and creative abilities. I will be learning tools from GSAP for animations.

## Design Concept
In the first version of my portfolio I incorporated the use of a hexagon background along with hexagon buttons. The idea behind this came from a documentary I watched explaining why everything in the natural world has certain shapes. One focus was how efficient the hexagon was and objects that arrange themselves in a hexagonal structure, like snowflakes. I will continue to focus and build on this idea on this project.
